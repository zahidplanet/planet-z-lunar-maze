# planet-z-lunar-maze

The maze project gave me a lot more excitement into the possibilities and opportunities of working in VR and how I can tie my music and architectural design experience into one place.

One aspect I enjoyed about it was that it's a lot more easy to test and predict the end results compared to AR. I think one has a lot more control over the environment and parameters and therefore, it's a lot easier to build out a smooth experience.

Some issues I ran into were more related to really understanding how to properly map out the different layer masks for the XR Interactions, XR Ray Interactions and left and right hand interactions. That part was pretty confusing but was able to get the hang of it after awhile.

The environment and 3D assets I think was what I was most excited about as well as something I found to be what took up more of my time. Although I'd usually purchase pre-made assets, this project gave me an opportunity to actually experience and move through many of my own architectural designs and interact with many 3D assets I've created on my own.

In terms of architectural design and floor planning, I used a new plugin for Rhino 3D called PlanFinder that generates floor plans based on simple area boundaries.
